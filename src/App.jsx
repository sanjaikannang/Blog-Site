              One-way cabs provide a dedicated space along with door to door
              connectivity to its commuters. This takes care of any safety

              high-risk public places such as airports or train stations.

                Our one way car rentals are cheaper. The fares may seem higher
                for a few states, but they include all state and toll taxes,
                which means you do not pay anything over and above the price
                displayed against your destination. Round trips on the other
                hand, do not include state and toll taxes. Hence, make use of
                Trippr's one-way launch discounts to avail the lowest fares for
                your upcoming journeys.
